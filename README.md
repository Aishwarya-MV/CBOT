# CBOT
This repository contains the code that runs the pick-and-place robot, C-BOT, that I made.

About C-BOT:
It's a small pick and place robot that has small actuators for its arms and torso. It works by rotating the arm actuators to an angle of 90 degrees. The user places an object. The actuator for the torso turns 90 degrees and the arms come back to the original position, releasing the object.
